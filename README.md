## Syllabus

Generative Design


## COURSE DESCRIPTION
This course is an introduction to the concepts and principles of computer programming while developing the skills required for creating generative work. Computers and computer code are everywhere around us. They run a large part of our life, organize our schedules, play our music, help us communicate, etc. In art and design software is used in a variety of stages in the production of new work. In your own practice, you probably make use of software on a daily basis. Most software that we use is a tool that was written for us by someone else, therefore you are limited in the way you use it by what the author of the software deemed necessary to include in it. Many artists and designers have started writing their own software to not be limited by the constrains that proprietary software may impose. The goal of this course is to get you started with using code to create your own custom software applications and to learn how express your ideas in code.

## COURSE LEARNING OUTCOMES
Students in Generative Design will be able to: (CLO1) Create code based imagery, (CLO2) Develop for non-traditional contexts, (CLO3) Create non-traditional interactive experiences, (CLO4) Foundational understanding of programming, (CLO5) Present their work and give a meaningful explanation of it to their peers as well as critique the work of their peers.

## SECTION DESCRIPTION
Each class is divided into three parts; critique, lecture, and demonstration/workshop. We will work on 4 medium size projects to practice implementing what you’ve learned in each module. Each project is a mix of design and technical challenges. The projects will start off simple but will become more challenging as your knowledge of programming grows. Halfway through the course you will create a website for your midterm where you can upload your sketches. At the end of the course you’re expected to create a final project that incorporates what you've learned including emotion, narrative, and sound. The project is open-ended and requires you to create a unique code-based work.

All sketches and other homework files must be uploaded to the class dropbox folder. In the class dropbox folder you will find a folder with your name. In this folder you will find a folder for each project that you will be doing in class. When handing in a project, copy your sketch and any other related files into the corresponding project’s folder.
