## Final Project


Our assignments so far have been fairly restrictive. For your final project, I want to open up the field for you to create an artwork of your choice. The requirement is that it uses code, emotion, narrative, and sound in some way in the project. You don’t need to use p5.js if there is another library or language that you prefer. I’m open to you working in something like Max Msp, Touch Designer, or other node based editors. If there is a special topic that we have not covered in class (shaders / 3d / sound programming / image manipulation etc. ) that you would like to explore that would be ok as well.

Please prepare a proposal to share with the class for Monday November 27. Your proposal must include a description of your piece, how you plan to show it, and at least three references or inspiration projects. The proposal doesn’t need to be more than 2-3 short paragraphs. I will do whatever I can to help aid in the completion of your project.
